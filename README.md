Assume the user has installed Rust. 

For the first time: Run `rustc --help` to check Rust is installed.

Then: 

1. If you install from source code, build this program.
2. Run this program and choose a Rust script. Rust will build and execute the target script.
3. The compiled target script is saved at `dist/` relative to the script, and have the same name (except extension).
